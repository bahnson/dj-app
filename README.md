# dj-app

Dj app that helps with logging transitions and organizing sets based on your track library.
The app is based on [maximegris' angular-electron template](https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron) - big hat tip to maximegris!

# Prerequisites

- Git 
- Nodejs
- Angular CLI

# Introduction

Run ``` npm start ``` in the terminal window to start the app.
In the app, switch to the library tab and drag music files there, to get the app to know about your tracks. Files are expected to match pattern: &lt;artist&gt;-&lt;track&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;.
After import, switch to the transition tag ...

(!) Hot reload only pertains to the renderer process. The main electron process is not able to be hot reloaded, only restarted.

# TODO

- suggestion component, suggestion service, track-graph
- transition-details-wrapper into transition details
- download mat-icons and ship under assets 

# Misc

There is an issue with `yarn` and `node_modules` when the application is built by the packager. Please use `npm` as dependencies manager.

- **in a terminal window** -> npm start

Voila! You can use your Angular + Electron app in a local development environment with hot reload !

The application code is managed by `main.ts`. In this sample, the app runs with a simple Angular App (http://localhost:4200) and an Electron window.
The Angular component contains an example of Electron and NodeJS native lib import.
You can disable "Developer Tools" by commenting `win.webContents.openDevTools();` in `main.ts`.

## Use Electron / NodeJS / 3rd party libraries

As see in previous chapter, this sample project runs on both mode (web and electron). To make this happens, **you have to import your dependencies the right way**. Please check `providers/electron.service.ts` to watch how conditional import of libraries has to be done when using electron / NodeJS / 3rd party librairies in renderer context (ie. Angular).

## Browser mode

Maybe you only want to execute the application in the browser with hot reload ? Just run `npm run ng:serve:web`.

## Included Commands

|Command|Description|
|--|--|
|`npm run ng:serve`| Execute the app in the browser |
|`npm run build`| Build the app. Your built files are in the /dist folder. |
|`npm run build:prod`| Build the app with Angular aot. Your built files are in the /dist folder. |
|`npm run electron:local`| Builds your application and start electron
|`npm run electron:build`| Builds your application and creates an app consumable based on your operating system |

**Your application is optimised. Only /dist folder and node dependencies are included in the executable.**

## You want to use a specific lib (like rxjs) in electron main thread ?

YES! You can do it! Just by importing your library in npm dependencies section (not **devDependencies**) with `npm install --save`. It will be loaded by electron during build phase and added to your final package. Then use your library by importing it in `main.ts` file. Quite simple, isn't it ?

## E2E Testing

E2E Test scripts can be found in `e2e` folder.

|Command|Description|
|--|--|
|`npm run e2e`| Execute end to end tests |

Note: To make it work behind a proxy, you can add this proxy exception in your terminal  
`export {no_proxy,NO_PROXY}="127.0.0.1,localhost"`
